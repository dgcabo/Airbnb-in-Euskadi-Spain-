### Installations
It is crucial to have the following tools and libraries installed:
- The latest version of Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and ast â€” although these will be automatically imported when running the Jupyter Notebook file.

### Project motivation
This project has aimed to analyze the current situation of Airbnb's business in this region of Spain, with the main objective of identifying the area or town with the highest profitability. This is intended to serve as a guiding model for future real estate investments in the area.
For this purpose, the following question will be answered:
1. Which are the areas in Euskadi have the highest occupancy rates throughout the year?
2. Which areas in Euskadi show the highest demand relative to the number of available accommodations, indicating that demand significantly exceeds supply?
3. Which features have the greatest impact on demand, and which ones most influence rental price in the Airbnb market in these areas?

The file related to this study belong to airbnb, and have been donwloaded from the official website.
